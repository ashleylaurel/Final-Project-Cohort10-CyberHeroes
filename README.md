# Hello Project
## This is our Final Project for 23 Code Street

It is an excellent Project

It is a JavaScript canvas game that teaches children about safety online.

There are inclusive characters that were created in 8-bit pixel art style.

There is a leaderboard which keeps track of scores that are determined by a user's speed of answering the questions.
